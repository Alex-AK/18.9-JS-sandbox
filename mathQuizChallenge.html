Ask at least five questions

Keep track of the number of questions the user answered correctly

Provide a final message after the quiz letting the user know the number of questions he or she got right.

Rank the player. If the player answered all five correctly, give that player the gold crown:
3-4 is a silver crown; 1-2 correct answers is a bronze crown and 0 correct is no crown at all.
